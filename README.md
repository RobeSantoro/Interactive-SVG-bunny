# AvatarSVG

I made this repo to investigate all the possibility for SVG creation using:

- Illustrator
- Copy to SVG plugin in Adobe XD
- WebExport plugin for Adobe XD
- Straight export as SVG in Adobe XD

The javascript part this is just a simple exercise, I'm not sure the logic is well implemented.

The last attempt is the final version:
08_XD
