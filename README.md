# AvatarSVG

I made this repo to investigate all the possibility for SVG creation using:

- Illustrator
- Copy to SVG plugin in Adobe XD
- WebExport plugin for Adobe XD
- Straight export as SVG in Adobe XD

For the javascript side this is just an exercise, I'm not sure the logic is well implemented.

The last attempt is the finale version:
